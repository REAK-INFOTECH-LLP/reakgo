//TODO

* Flash Implementation
        - Build utility function to manage flash messages in a flash buffer managed
        through sessions.
        - Build faux ExecuteTemplate function inside utility which injects flashes into the
        data payload of the template and then call the relevant template.

        - Injecting algo will require to be tested against Structs, Interfaces and maps to
        make it a global integration

* Better MOTD
        - Have a better MOTD once the build has started

* Struct Scanning
        - Struct scanning needs to be improved to avoid mapping individual struct members against
          addresses, should be a complete struct map to ease up the developers
